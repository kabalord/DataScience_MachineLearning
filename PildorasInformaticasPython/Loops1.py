# Loops

'''
Loops

the usefulness is to repeat one or more lines of code several times.

Types of Loops :

Determined:
    - They are executed a certain number of times.
    - It is known a priori how many times the code inside the loop is going to be executed.


Indeterminate:
    - They are executed an indeterminate number of times.
    - It is not known a priori how many times the code inside the loop will be executed.
    - The number of times it will be executed will depend on the circumstances during the execution of the program.
